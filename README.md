Some python test programs.

To set up for CLion:
- Use a python3 virtual environment - this is set up in CLion preferences. 
There is one virtual environment in ~/Develop/python3/venv that 
can be shared between projects.
- Create a run configuration where the python script is referred to as module and
using the runtime set up as a virtual environment (Use specified interpreter).
